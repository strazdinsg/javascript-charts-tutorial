# HTML, CSS, Javascript, SVG, Google charts and D3.js tutorial

The tutorial builds from ground up: starting with HTML and CSS basics, some
Javascript programming principles, and then goes into Javascript charts. It is
suggested that you study the HTML files in the root directory first, then take
either google-charts or d3-charts folders and follow the HTML files there.

It assumes that you are familiar with programming in general, and hopefully have
experience with either Java, or PHP.

The whole tutorial is example based. Look at the example HTML files ordered by
filename: 01-..., 02-...

There are not too many comments. If you feel lack of explanation, consider other
tutorials or search StackOverflow. D3 tutorial by Dashing is recommended as a
good one to fill in more
details: https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents . It is a bit outdated,
but covers most topics very well.
